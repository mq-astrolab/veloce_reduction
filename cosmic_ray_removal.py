    '''
    This routine identifies cosmic rays via Laplacian edge detection based on the method (ie LACosmic) described by van Dokkum et al., 2001, PASP, 113:1420 
    Should be slightly faster than the python translation of LACosmics by Malte Tewes, as it uses "ndimage" rather than "signal" package for convolution.
    
    INPUT:
    "img"       - a 2-dim image
    "gain"      - gain in electrons per ADU 
    "RON"       - read-out noise in electrons
    "Flim"      - lower threshold for the identification of a pixel as a cosmic ray when using L+/F (ie Laplacian image divided by fine-structure image) (= lbarplus/F2 in the implementation below)
    "siglim"    - sigma threshold for identification as cosmic in S_prime
    
    OUTPUT:
    "final_mask"   - a boolean mask, where True identifies pixels affected by cosmic rays. This mask has the same dimensions as the input image "img"
    
    To Do List:
    This basically only identifies the cosmics. If I ever have time, I will try to implement a method similar to Bai et al., 2017, PASP, 129:024004
